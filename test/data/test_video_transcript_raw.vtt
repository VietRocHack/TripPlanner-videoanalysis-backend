00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.320
We are trying the viral Mama's two Chicken Cutlet

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.960
vodka sandwich.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:06.960
To be honest,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.320
I'm a bit turned on.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.740
We got chicken cutlet, burrata,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.800
vodka sauce,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.700
handmade pesto,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.440
and freshly baked bread.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.280
I mean, are you kidding me?

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.880
There's a lot of rumor that this is one of

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.880
the best chicken salad sandwiches in New York City.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.280
They sell out in like,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.280
three hours.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.820
Look at that bread. Holy shit.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.700
This. Wow. This is fucking special.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.660
If this weren't essentially in China,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.040
I would be here once a week.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.560
But it took me an hour to get here.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.080
But thank god,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.600
there obey go

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.420
store in the West Village for everyone else to go try.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.760
My god, this bread is god like.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.600
This has got to be one of

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.443
the best chicken going sandwiches in all New York City.
