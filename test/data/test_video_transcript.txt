We are trying the viral Mama's two Chicken Cutlet
vodka sandwich.
To be honest,
I'm a bit turned on.
We got chicken cutlet, burrata,
vodka sauce,
handmade pesto,
and freshly baked bread.
I mean, are you kidding me?
There's a lot of rumor that this is one of
the best chicken salad sandwiches in New York City.
They sell out in like,
three hours.
Look at that bread. Holy shit.
This. Wow. This is fucking special.
If this weren't essentially in China,
I would be here once a week.
But it took me an hour to get here.
But thank god,
there obey go
store in the West Village for everyone else to go try.
My god, this bread is god like.
This has got to be one of
the best chicken going sandwiches in all New York City.
